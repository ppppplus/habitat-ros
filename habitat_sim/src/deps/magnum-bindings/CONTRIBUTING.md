Bug reports, feature requests or code contributions are always very welcome.
To make things easier, here are a few tips:

Reporting bugs, requesting features
-----------------------------------

-   Best way to report bugs and request new features is to use GitHub
    [Issues](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-bindings/issues), but you can
    contact the team also any other way — see the [README](README.md) for
    details.

Code contribution
-----------------

-   Best way to contribute is using GitHub [Pull Requests](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-bindings/pulls)
    — fork the repository and make a pull request from a feature branch. You
    can also send patches via e-mail or contact the team in any other way — see
    the [README](README.md) for details.
-   Follow the project coding guidelines. In short — try to match style of the
    surrounding code and avoid any trailing whitespace. For C++, there's the
    [C++ Coding Style](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/coding-style.html).
-   All your code will be released under the project license (see the
    [COPYING](COPYING) file for details), so make sure you and your
    collaborators (or employers) have no problems with it.
